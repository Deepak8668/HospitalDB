Here’s a strong Answer #1 you can paste (it’s 200+ characters and matches what you described):

I want to use End User GenAI to speed up my day-to-day reporting and analytics work with Medicaid beneficiary data. I regularly pull and filter vendor files in Databricks, then build Tableau dashboards and Excel reports to track coder productivity, quality, and performance trends. GenAI can help me quickly summarize large datasets, draft clear insights for stakeholders, generate calculated field ideas, validate logic/filters, and create consistent narrative write-ups for performance charts and weekly/monthly reporting.


Sure — here are Answer #2 and Answer #3 (each is 100+ characters).

2) Existing business process – how do you do this today?

Today, I receive Medicaid beneficiary files from the vendor, then use Databricks to clean, filter, sort, and validate the data. I export the curated datasets into Excel and Tableau to build performance dashboards and charts, track coder productivity/quality, and share weekly/monthly reports with stakeholders.

3) What is the expected output?

I expect a clean, analysis-ready dataset and automated reporting outputs such as Tableau dashboards and Excel summaries. The output should include clear performance metrics (volume, accuracy/QA trends, turnaround time/SLA), visuals, and a short narrative summary highlighting key findings, outliers, and action items.

4) Business Value Added (100+ characters)

Using SecureGPT/End User GenAI will improve productivity and accuracy in our risk mitigation reporting by accelerating data analysis, summarizing findings from large Medicaid/MA datasets, and generating clear narratives for Tableau/Excel dashboards. This reduces manual effort, shortens turnaround time for stakeholder requests, and supports better decisions on coder performance, compliance, and vendor oversight while maintaining consistency and quality.
